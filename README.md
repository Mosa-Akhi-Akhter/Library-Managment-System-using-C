Project Title: Library Management System in C Language (Code::Blocks)

Description:

Our Library Management System is a robust and efficient software solution designed to streamline the processes of a library. This project, implemented in C language and developed using Code::Blocks, empowers librarians and library administrators with powerful tools to manage books, patrons, and library resources seamlessly.

Features:

User-friendly Interface: The system offers a simple and intuitive user interface developed using Code::Blocks, making it easy for library staff to navigate and perform various tasks.

Book Management: Easily add, update, and remove books from the library catalog. Each book is categorized by title, author, ISBN, and genre.

Patron Management: Maintain a database of library patrons with essential information, including name, contact details, and membership status.

Borrowing and Returning: Facilitate the borrowing and returning of books by patrons, with due date reminders and fine calculation.

Search and Filters: Implement powerful search and filtering options within the Code::Blocks environment to help users find books efficiently based on various criteria.

Reporting: Generate reports on book availability, overdue books, and library statistics using Code::Blocks features to aid in decision-making.

Security: Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure data security and access control within the Code::Blocks project.

Data Backup: Regularly backup and restore the library database within the Code::Blocks environment to prevent data loss.
